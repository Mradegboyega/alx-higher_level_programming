# N-Queens Problem and Rectangle Classes

This repository contains Python scripts that address various tasks related to the N-Queens problem and Rectangle classes.

## Tasks

### 0. Simple Rectangle
- File: `0-rectangle.py`
- Description: An empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

### 1. Real definition of a rectangle
- File: `1-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with private attributes `width` and `height`, and methods to retrieve and set them.

### 2. Area and Perimeter
- File: `2-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with additional methods `area` and `perimeter`.

### 3. String representation
- File: `3-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with methods for string representation using `print()` and `str()`.

### 4. Eval is magic
- File: `4-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with methods for string representation using `print()`, `str()`, and `repr()` to recreate instances using `eval()`.

### 5. Detect instance deletion
- File: `5-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with methods for string representation and a message when an instance is deleted.

### 6. How many instances
- File: `6-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with methods for string representation, instance counting, and a message when an instance is deleted.

### 7. Change representation
- File: `7-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with methods for string representation, instance counting, and a message when an instance is deleted. Additionally, a public class attribute `print_symbol` is added.

### 8. Compare rectangles
- File: `8-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with methods for string representation, instance counting, a message when an instance is deleted, and a static method `bigger_or_equal` to compare rectangles based on area.

### 9. A square is a rectangle
- File: `9-rectangle.py`
- Description: Class `Rectangle` with methods for string representation, instance counting, a message when an instance is deleted, a static method `bigger_or_equal` to compare rectangles based on area, and a class method `square` to create a square rectangle.

### 10. N Queens
- File: `101-nqueens.py`
- Description: Python script that solves the N-Queens problem. Usage: `./101-nqueens.py N`, where N is an integer greater than or equal to 4. Prints every possible solution to the problem.
