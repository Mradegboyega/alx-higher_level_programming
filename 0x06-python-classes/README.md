This README provides an overview of the Python tasks completed, including a brief description of each task.
Task 0: My First Square

Description:
In this task, an empty class Square is defined. The class serves as the initial step in creating a representation for a square in Python.
Task 1: Square with Size

Description:
The Square class is extended with a private instance attribute size. This attribute represents the size of the square.
Task 2: Size Validation

Description:
Enhancements are made to the Square class to include validation for the size attribute. The size must be an integer, and if less than 0, it raises a ValueError. This task demonstrates basic input validation.
Task 3: Area of a Square

Description:
The Square class is further developed to include a public method area that calculates and returns the area of the square. This task illustrates the addition of functionality to compute the area of the square.
Task 4: Access and Update Private Attribute

Description:
The Square class is modified to include properties for accessing and updating the private attribute size. This encapsulation technique provides controlled access to the class attributes.
Task 5: Printing a Square

Description:
The Square class is expanded with a public method my_print that prints the square using the character #. This task demonstrates the use of basic printing in Python and how to represent a square visually.
Task 6: Coordinates of a Square

Description:
The Square class is further extended with a private instance attribute position and corresponding properties. This task introduces the concept of positioning the square in a two-dimensional space.
Task 7: Singly Linked List

Description:
This advanced task involves creating two classes: Node and SinglyLinkedList. The Node class defines a node of a singly linked list, and the SinglyLinkedList class represents a singly linked list. The linked list supports insertion in sorted order.
Task 8: Print Square Instance

Description:
The Square class is modified to include a __str__ method that provides a string representation of the square. This allows printing a Square instance to have the same behavior as the my_print method.
Task 9: Compare 2 Squares

Description:
The Square class is updated to allow instantiation with a number (float or integer). Comparison methods (__eq__, __ne__, __gt__, __ge__, __lt__, __le__) are added based on the square areas. This task demonstrates the implementation of comparison operations for custom classes.
